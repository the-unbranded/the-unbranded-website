              a nature theme, something that conveys tranquility, knowledge, approachability, curiosity and a

      <p class="social-justice-body">
        Social justice is an integral value at The Unbranded. We believe that ethical business practices and 
        creativity should go hand in hand, and we are dedicated to working with clients and collaborators who 
        believe in creating equity in representation at every level of business. We are committed to removing 
        the gatekeeping of professional marketing services and making them accessible to all creative business 
        owners. Our rate structure and pro-bono work will reflect a sustained dedication to taking on clients 
        from traditionally marginalized groups, and we are always looking for new ways to incorporate positive 
        social justice change into the everyday workings of the business.

        Below you will find links to groups that co-owners currently feel need a spotlight. These groups have 
        been vetted as far as any individual could vet a non-profit; we do not have resources beyond what an 
        individual is capable of researching and we reserve the right to rescind links as new information 
        surfaces. As with everything, this is a learning process, and admitting and learning from mistakes is 
        important. As often as possible, if an organization is removed from our links because of a change of 
        heart, we will share that information on our blog. Many links will be changed due to the team wanting 
        to highlight more pressing issues, and links that we continue to support can be found on our Social 
        Justice Archive page. <!--ADD LINK ONCE PAGE CREATED-->

          <div class="bio-info">
            <p>Amelita has always had an instinct for management and organization. Beginning her executive career at age four when 
              she dutifully (and, in retrospect, likely annoyingly) pointed out who was off of their line in ballet class, she has 
              honed that intuition through a wide variety of jobs – working in everything from retail and fine dining to musical 
              comedy and film production, with pit stops along the way to pick up some dog training skills and an undergrad degree 
              from NYU. Her non-traditional path (though stressful for her parents) has taught her that following her gut when it 
              comes to ethical values is essential and that this principle too often gets lost within workplaces. While pivoting 
              to coding and design in the chaos of 2020, the idea for The Unbranded presented itself as an opportunity to 
              constructively exercise her management skills, and more importantly put her values into practice. She is incredibly 
              grateful and excited to get to do both with such a remarkable team beside her.</p>
